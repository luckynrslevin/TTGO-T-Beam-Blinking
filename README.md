# TTGO-T-Beam-Blinking
LED Blinking example for TTGO T-Beam

Since I was struggeling a lot and it took me quite some hours to collect the necessary information and adapt it to bring up my TTGO T-Beam using the Arduino IDE I decided tho share my experience and results.

1) Hardware
There are different versions of the TTGO T-Beam and I have the one with the three buttons next to the micro USB connector, not sure which version number this is.

2) Arduino IDE configuration

3) References
The most important hint on the axp library I found in this issue within the official LilyGO repository:

In addition the hint in this issue on a new repository, where I found working binary firmware images I was able to flash with esptool.py and the related sample code:
